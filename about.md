### My journey

I graudated New York University with a B.S. degree in hotel management, concentrating in revenue management. Lo and behold, today my reputation precedes me after spending 10 years optimizing revenues at various hotel in New York metropolitan area. My favorite part about my previous job was having full access to all kinds of data: digital marketing, website, guest profiles, hotel financials, cost analyses, hotel performance, market performance, and the list goes on. Little did I know then that I building crude but functional unsupervised models to discover trends and insights for audiences like hotel executives, asset managers, and ownership groups.

Finally, I have gathered the courage to pursue what I am most passionate in. During my time at BrainStation, I had the most exciting time analyzing data from other verticals. Now with a diploma in Data Science and the fundamentals of Statistics, Machine Learning, and Coding, I'm ready to explore whatever comes my way.
